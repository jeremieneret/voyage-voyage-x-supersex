    <div className="text">
      <p>I watched this Italian TV show, <b>Supersex</b>, on Netflix. At the end of Episode 02, there is an explicit scene with <span><b>Voyage Voyage</b> by <b>Desireless</b></span> as the soundtrack.</p>
      <p>I found the synchronization amazing and wanted to enhance the experience further.</p>
      <p>So, I made my own edit of <b>Voyage Voyage</b>, altering its structure to fit the story. I attempted to depict in five minutes how the young Rocco became Siffredi. You can watch the entire show for more details!</p>
      <p>Thatâ€™s how this little project was born.</p>
      <p>Thank you for watching!</p>
